Framsticks SDK was first published by Szymon Ulatowski and Maciej Komosinski in 1999
as a small part of Framsticks source code, mainly concerned with the processing of genotypes
(loading, saving, converting between genetic formats, mutating, crossing over, checking, 
validating, highlighting syntax, etc.).

Since then, new pieces of source code are constantly added to facilitate the interaction
with the Framsticks project, the usage of its pieces in related applications, and testing.
In cooperation with the Framsticks authors, other developers were involved in improving
the existing source code, implementing of ideas and contributing sources:

	Adam Rotaru-Varga - initial versions of the f4 genetic encoding,
	Marek Kubiak - initial versions of the similarity measure,
	Agnieszka Mensfelt - the similarity measure and the SVD,
	Grzegorz Latosinski - genetic encodings: f4, fH, fB, fL.
